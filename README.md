# Griffin Powermate to X11 Scroll Events

This is a simple C file I hacked together to make the Griffin PowerMate work as a scrollwheel in X11. Note that this does not work under Wayland.

Complicated bits were copied from the [Linux driver for the Griffin Powermate](https://sowerbutts.com/powermate/)
